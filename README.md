End-to-end routine to locate and measure the size and colour of tomato fruit from handheld image sequences. This is achieved through a combination of instance segmentation and modern Structure from Motion (SfM) methods. Our approach is time-efficient and easy to implement in both small gardens and large greenhouse environments. Measuring tomato fruit size by hand, for example with a calliper, is limited by the symmetry of the fruit shape. In addition to estimating the fruit diameter, we can measure deviations from the targeted spherical topology with millimetre precision and incorporate any morphological abnormalities.
